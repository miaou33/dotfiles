I'm a student in computer science in 42 paris. 

I currently am working on a new project which consists in implementing a HTTP server from scratch in c++. 

Our code must comply with the C++ 98 standard. Then, it should still compile with the flag -std=c++98. 
We can use C functions, but only if no solutions exists in C++.

Any external library and Boost libraries are forbidden.

We only need to handle GET, POST and DELETE methods.

Our server must be able to listen to multiple ports.
Our server must never block and the client can be bounced properly if necessary.

I use epoll as I/O multiplexer.

I am interested in learning the mecanisms of what I code.
